An addon that keeps track of all your sales and postings on the Auction House, sales and purchases with vendors, crafting orders, quest rewards and item drops, provides a summary view, sales percentage stats for the last month, and lets you export the data to your favourite spreadsheet program. Works on Retail, SoM, and Wrath.

To see your summary click the minimap icon or run the slash command `/jnr`.
